    This saves the icons of pages that use a specific remote image to represent
    their icon when saving. If link icons aren't saved, the page's icon will be
    retrieved via the browser's history icon mechanism, which may be not be
    the same as what icon was visible when the tab was closed, and may be lost
    when importing or exporting tab data.

    This saves icons for pages that compute a local image for their icon, such
    as the icon with a number of unread messages in Gmail. While this will give
    an exact record for the page's icon, it is usually an unnecessarily precise
    amount of detail, and it will take up most of the storage space for saving
    any tab that specifies its icon as local data (several times more than the
    tab's location and title).
